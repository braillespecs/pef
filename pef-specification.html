<h2 id="Introducti">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>This section is informative.</strong> </p>

<h3 id="What">What is PEF?</h3>

<p>PEF is a document type that represents braille pages in digital form,
accurately and unambiguously; regardless of language, location, embosser
settings, braille code and computer environment. It can be used for braille
embossing and archiving anywhere in the world, no matter where nor how it was
produced. PEF allows new features to be added such as ink overlay or tactile
graphics, thus enabling a completely automatic production of advanced braille
books.</p>

<h3 id="there">Why is PEF necessary?</h3>

<p>PEF brings a number of things to braille production:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Metadata. A PEF file provides information about its contents.</li>
  <li>A braille publishing standard. The PEF file format defines what it is
    and how it should be used in a publicly available standard.</li>
  <li>A proper file format for braille. Having a proper file format means,
    among other things, that file integrity can be tested to detect
  errors.</li>
  <li>World wide file sharing. Because PEF is specified and the braille
    representation unambiguous, it can be shared with anyone in the world.
    For example, braille music is very expensive to produce, but the braille
    code used in musical notation is the same all over the world. With PEF,
    this material can be shared in electronic form with anyone.</li>
  <li>Archive safety. Because PEF is specified and the braille representation
    unambiguous, it can safely be archived for the future.</li>
  <li>Economy. Publishing and republishing of braille can be achieved quickly
    and easily because files can be shared across the world, without any
    worry about embosser settings. Users can become publishers and providers
    can share resources and reduce costs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="What1">What is Unicode?</h3>

<p>Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter what the
platform, no matter what the program, no matter what the language [<a
class="nref" href="#ref-unicode">Unicode]</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, computers just deal with numbers. They store letters and
other characters by assigning a number for each one. Before Unicode was
invented, there were hundreds of different encoding systems for assigning
these numbers. No single encoding could contain enough characters: for
example, the European Union alone requires several different encodings to
cover all its languages. Even for a single language like English no single
encoding was adequate for all the letters, punctuation, and technical symbols
in common use.</p>

<p>These encoding systems also conflict with one another. That is, two
encodings can use the same number for two different characters, or use
different numbers for the same character. Any given computer (especially
servers) needs to support many different encodings; yet whenever data is
passed between different encodings or platforms, that data always runs the
risk of corruption.</p>

<h3 id="Unicode">Why Use Unicode Braille Patterns?</h3>

<p>PEF uses Unicode braille patterns rather than ASCII characters for several
reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unicode and the Unicode braille patterns are locale independent. The
    translation between ASCII characters and braille patterns isn’t. For
    example, common characters like ‘.’, ‘?’, ‘(‘, ‘)’,
    ‘+’, ‘$’, ‘%’ and ‘#’ render different braille patterns
    depending on locale. It is impossible to send an ASCII file for embossing
    on an embosser configured for another locale. This is a major issue for
    the non English speaking part of the world and it is the main reason to
    use Unicode braille patterns instead of ASCII characters to represent
    braille.</li>
  <li>Unicode braille pattern are unambiguous. Even if there were only one
    braille pattern for each ASCII character, the interpretation would still
    be ambiguous, since ASCII braille bluntly redefines ASCII characters as
    braille patterns. There is no standardized, automatic method of
    determining if the file actually contains braille; it could just be a
    corrupted text file.</li>
  <li>The Unicode braille patterns are part of the Unicode standard, a global
    and widely accepted standard. ASCII braille does not follow any known
    standard.</li>
  <li>Translating from Unicode braille patterns into any locally used ASCII
    based braille format, is a simple one-to-one-mapping. However, the
    opposite is not true, unless you know beforehand which locale it was
    produced for.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="What2">What is XML?</h3>

<p>XML™ is the acronym for Extensible Markup Language [<a class="nref"
href="#ref-xml">XML</a>]. It was conceived as a means of retaining the power
and flexibility of SGML, while reducing its complexity.</p>

<h3 id="L249">Why Use XML?</h3>

<p>PEF uses XML because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It allows metadata. A PEF file can contain information about its
    contents.</li>
  <li>It is extensible. New features can easily be introduced in future
    versions, such as ink overlay or tactile graphics. Third party custom
    features such as heading or paragraph markers are also possible via
    namespace additions.</li>
  <li>XML tools are widely available and easy to use. No parsing or
    validating tools must be developed to implement PEF.</li>
  <li>It allows structural markup. Following XML convention, PEF uses markup
    rather than control characters for structural elements such as rows and
    pages. Structural markup simplifies processing in an XML-environment and
    ensures compatibility with future extensions.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="What3">On Hardware Limitations</h3>

<p>Typically, embossers have very limited RAM and processing power, and might
not be able to read and interpret PEF files natively. However, the PEF
specification does not require that PEF support is implemented in the
embosser's hardware. Support for PEF can alternatively be added to the
embosser print driver or other bundled software.</p>

<h3 id="Scope">Scope Limitations</h3>

<p>PEF has a clear scope and there are many problems with braille production
that PEF neither can, nor should, solve. For example, issues involving:</p>
<ul>
  <li>editing</li>
  <li>reformatting</li>
  <li>reflowing</li>
  <li>repurposing</li>
  <li>reverse translation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Future">Future</h3>

<p>Currently, there is very little common ground between embossers.
Consequently it is impossible to guarantee that layout will be exactly as
specified in this document. Future versions will define a minimum level of
layout control that an embosser must support.</p>

<h2 id="Normative">Definition of PEF 1.0</h2>

<p><strong>This section is normative.</strong> </p>

<h3 id="Document"><a name="docconf" id="docconf">Document Conformance</a>
</h3>

<p>A Conforming PEF Document is an XML document that requires only the
facilities described as mandatory in this specification. Such a document must
meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<ol class="plain">
  <li>It must conform to the constraints expressed in the <a
    href="#Relax">Relax NG rule set</a>.</li>
  <li>The root element of the document must be pef.</li>
  <li>The root element of the document must contain an xmlns declaration for
    the PEF namespace [<a href="#XMLNS">XMLNS</a>]. The namespace for PEF is
    defined to be http://www.daisy.org/ns/2008/pef. An example root element
    might look like:<br />
    &lt;pef xmlns="http://www.daisy.org/ns/2008/pef"&gt;</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Using">Using PEF with Other Namespaces</h4>

<p>The PEF namespace may be used with other XML namespaces as per [<a
href="#XMLNS">XMLNS</a>], although such documents are not strictly conforming
PEF 1.0 documents as defined above.</p>

<h3 id="User"><a name="uaconf" id="uaconf">User Agent Conformance</a> </h3>

<p>A conforming user agent must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<ol class="plain">
  <li>The user agent must parse and evaluate a PEF document for
    well-formedness.</li>
  <li>When the user agent claims to support facilities defined within this
    specification or required by this specification through normative
    reference, it must do so in ways consistent with the facilities'
    definition.</li>
  <li>The user agent must support UTF-8 encoding as per [<a class="nref"
    href="#ref-unicode">Unicode</a>].</li>
  <li>The user agent must support Unicode character range 2800-283F.</li>
  <li>If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize, it must
    process the element's child nodes, except its text node children. Note
    that text node descendants of the unrecognized element's child elements
    are not affected by this statement.</li>
  <li>If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize, it must
    ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute and its
    value).</li>
  <li>If a user agent encounters an attribute value it does not recognize, it
    must use the default attribute value.</li>
  <li>If a user agent encounters an entity reference (other than one of the
    entities defined in this or in the XML specification) for which the user
    agent has processed no declaration (which could happen if the declaration
    is in the external subset which the user agent hasn't read), the entity
    reference should be processed as the characters (starting with the
    ampersand and ending with the semi-colon) that make up the entity
    reference.</li>
</ol>

<p>A conforming user agent is recommended to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The user agent is recommended to support Unicode character range
    2840-28FF.</li>
  <li>The user agent is recommended to support UTF-16 encoding.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Error">Row Height</h3>

<p>Row height, excluding row gap, is four times the dot-to-dot height,
regardless of whether the user agent supports Unicode character range
2840-28FF or not.</p>

<h3 id="Page">Row Gap</h3>

<p>Row gap is expressed as an integer multiple of the dot-to-dot height.</p>

<h3 id="Page1">Page Alignment</h3>

<p>Pages align to the top-left corner of the page.</p>

<h3 id="Attribute1">Sections</h3>

<p>A section always starts on a blank sheet of paper.</p>

<h3 id="Attribute11">Attribute Value Inheritance</h3>

<p>The value specified by the attributes cols, rows, rowgap and duplex
applies to the element where it is specified, and to all elements in its
content unless overridden by another instance of these attributes.</p>

<h3 id="Internet">Internet Media Type</h3>

<p>PEF Documents may be labelled with the Internet Media Type
"application/x-pef+xml".</p>

<h2 id="Error1">Error Handling</h2>

<p><strong>This section is normative.</strong></p>

<p>If a user agent encounters a document that it is unable to process it must
inform the user and abort processing.</p>

<p>However, because of embosser limitations, fallback behaviour is acceptable
under the following circumstances:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>The user agent cannot set row distance to the specified value</dt>
    <dd>The user agent may choose the closest possible smaller or larger
      value that it supports, as long as no exception is raised as a
      consequence, and continue processing given that the user is informed.
      Optionally, the user agent may prompt the user before continuing.</dd>
  <dt>The user agent cannot set specified duplex value</dt>
    <dd>The user agent may choose a value that it supports and continue
      processing given that the user is informed. Optionally, the user agent
      may prompt the user before continuing.</dd>
  <dt>The user agent cannot divide into volumes</dt>
    <dd>The user agent may disregard volume division and continue processing
      given that the user is informed. Optionally, the user agent may prompt
      the user before continuing.</dd>
  <dt>The user agent cannot process braille patterns in range 2840-28FF</dt>
    <dd>If the document contains only a few braille patterns in the range
      2840-28FF, the user agent may prompt the user for one of the following
      actions: 
      <ol>
        <li>remove the unsupported braille patterns (rows will be
        shortened)</li>
        <li>replace the unsupported braille patterns with another braille
          pattern</li>
        <li>truncate the unsupported braille patterns, e.g. by bit masking
          the code point with 283F</li>
      </ol>
